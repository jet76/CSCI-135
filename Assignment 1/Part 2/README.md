# Part 2: Pattern  

Write a program Pattern.java that takes two integer command-line arguments N and M. You program should print an N by M "checkerboard" pattern of asterisks and periods. Each row should have 2N characters (alternating between asterisks and periods). There should be M rows of output. The first row should start with an asterisk, the second row should start with a period, and so on. If either N or M is an integer less than or equal to zero, nothing should be output. Here some example runs:  

% java Pattern 4 4  
\*.\*.\*.\*.  
.\*.\*.\*.\*  
\*.\*.\*.\*.  
.\*.\*.\*.\*  

% java Pattern 5 2  
\*.\*.\*.\*.\*.  
.\*.\*.\*.\*.\*  
 
% java Pattern 0 2  
 
% java Pattern 2 -2
