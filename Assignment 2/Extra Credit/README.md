# Extra credit
Create a more advanced version of the program RadarContactsEC.java by first copying RadarContacts.java. This version should, in addition to the distance, report the bearing to all contacts. The bearing should be in decimal degrees with 0 degrees being due north, 90 due east, etc. Report the bearing to one decimal place. For non-friendly contacts, also report the total number of friendly aircraft that are within the radius distance of the bogey.
